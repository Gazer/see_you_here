This app will allow people meet in a location and track where is each participant in real
time.

The app is a project to learn Flutter on my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqMwm3oGe6BhJUOrBdfnAEA), so you can see work to be done, things that will change and improvements that need to be done.
